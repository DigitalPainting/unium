# Focus
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* publishing alacarte
* integrating dev and master branches properly

# Now
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* add ip address to tutorial level

* test
  * file loading on android - both il2cpp and mono variants
  * file saving on android - both il2cpp and mono variants
  * alacarte on device

* look/fix integration tests


# Next
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* named queries

  /q/scene//Pickup#pickups

  #pickups/q/scene//Pickup
  pickups#/q/scene//Pickup

  /q/scene//[near($pickups)]



* attribute selector

  /q/scene//Player@Transform.position,MoveComp.velocity
  /q/scene//Player@Transform.position as pos,MoveComp.velocity as vel
  /q/scene//Player@Transform.position={1,2,3},SomeComp.DoAThing()
  /q/scene//Player@SomeComp.DoAThing()

* bugs?
  * make server work when swapping between background and foreground on device (test on phone)

* improvements
  * improve type conversion and argument parsing - e.g. when passing in vectors / objects to function calls

* profile - potential speed improvements
  * Numbers.Compare
  * remove regex for name matching
  * remove regex for path parsing

* features
  * callout feature - establish connection by calling out to a web server
  * do we need to (optinally) return type meta data on GQL queries?


# Later
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* call out to server

  * list of connected clients - user name, ip, version, level, in editor or in game, development build, etc
  * historical list / log
  * click to launch on-device debug menu for client
  * off-device debug menu?
  * "terminal mode" for "chatting" with client

  * run tests on connected clients


# Extensions
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Overlord - device manger / test runner
* A la Carte / Omakase - debug menu maker
* Editor Extensions - mimicking changes in editor to device
* Record and playback
* "Drivers" for different langugages
* Test Runner
